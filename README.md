## A r**eal video rental app (Web apps with ASP.NET MVC)**

A Sample project that secures web applications with [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) MVC 5 and builds APIs using [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Web API and uses Entity Framework (code-first) to store and retrieve data.

### Skills that I learn from this project:

- Implement CRUD operations
- Build forms with validation
- Build RESTful services using ASP.NET Web API
- Use Entity Framework code-first workflow to build a model
- Implement security, authentication, and authorization using ASP.NET Identity
- Use powerful jQuery plugins
- Optimize application's performance
- Build and deploy your applications
- Shortcuts to writing code fast

And much, much more...
